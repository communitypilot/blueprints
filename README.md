# CommunityPilot Blueprints


**Let's talk about overall CommunityPilot's mission.**
**by Batman**

Although there is hardware that will eventually need to be changed from EON to something else however as of right now the biggest challenge is open source models to improve overall driving experience.  

Although it might sound like we are trying to try to replicate some of the Tesla's autopilot features however the main focus for the project is to build L3 system that is open source except for staying with L2 where only thing it can do right now is just stay in lane but it can do even more with help of community.

I did share some of my ideas on openpilot-traffic paper which can be found [here](https://github.com/icmma/openpilot-traffic) 


## ML and DL

**So what else can we improve with ML & DL?**

Well there are a lot of things we can improve but following is list of things i have come up with so far:

 - Traffic Lights and Stop signs

 - Allow cut-in

 - navigate on pilot

 - objects recognization such as pedestrians, bicycles.

 - Summon (work in progress by [shane)](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/phantom-app)

## Hardware

**To improve the project we need  360 Vision**

## Conclusion

> ## Please see full repo for other projects but overall this paper focused mainly on machine learning improvements.
